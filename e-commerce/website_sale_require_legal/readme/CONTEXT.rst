This module adds the functionality to require the user to check the checkbox to accept
the legal terms in the address form. Additionally, it provides a metadata record for
both the user when legal terms are accepted through the address form and for the sales
order when legal terms are accepted during the payment process.

It's worth noting that this module can be useful even if the acceptance of legal terms
in the address form is not activated, as it stores a metadata record when the terms and
conditions are accepted during the payment process, even if a new address has not been
created.
