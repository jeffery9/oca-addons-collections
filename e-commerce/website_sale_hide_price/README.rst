This module allows to have hidden product prices on the website store.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

If you want to hide prices at customer level:

1. Go to *Customers* and choose one.
2. Go to *Sales and Purchases* tab.
3. In *Sales* group set *Show prices on website* on or off so this
   customer can see them or not. The default value is True, so every
   partner website user can see the prices.

For not logged in customers:

1. If you want to have the prices hidden by default when no user is
   logged in you should go to Public User's partner and set *Show prices
   on website* off. (Remember that the Public User's user and partner
   use to be archived).

Hide prices at product level:

1. Go to *Website > Catalog > Products* and choose one.
2. Go to *eCommerce* tab.
3. In the *Shop* section you have the option *Hide prices on website*.
4. You can optionally set a message that will be displayed when the
   prices are hidden.

If you want to hide prices at website level

1. Go to *Website > Configuration > Settings* and choose the website to
   hide the prices.
2. In the *Shop - Products* section you have the option *Hide prices on
   website*

Usage
=====

After configuring the module go to the website store and check your
expected results:

1. On the search box writing the name of a product.
2. On the product list (/shop).
3. On the product page.
4. On the recently viewed products.

You shouldn't be able to either see the prices or buy any of the
forbidden items if any.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

-  This module is incompatible with the website_sale_stock_force_block
   module because it makes changes to the same attributes in the
   website_sale.products_add_to_cart template.
