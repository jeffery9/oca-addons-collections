Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

1. Go to **Events > Configuration > Registrations cancellation reasons**
   for setting the possible reasons you want to handle.

You can also set if a reason is only available for certain types of
events or if you leave it empty, for all.

Usage
=====

1. Go to **Events > Events**
2. Enter into the details of any of the events.
3. Press the button "Attendees", located at the top right hand corner.
4. Press the red button in the right part of any of the registrations.
5. A new screen will appear asking you to enter the reason why the
   registration is cancelled.

You will get also the same screen:

1. Go to **Events > Reporting > Attendees (view list)**.
2. Enter into the details of any of the attendees.
3. Press the button *Cancel registration*.

On this object, you can group by the cancellation reason in the list,
calendar or graph view.
