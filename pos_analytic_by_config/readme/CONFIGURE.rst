To configure the analytic distributions by store:

#. Go to *Invoicing > Configuration > Analytic Distribution Models*
#. We'll create one for every pos config.
#. Select an account prefix (Normally your incoming account prefix)
#. Select a PoS config (unhide it from the optionl fields).
#. Choose your desired distribution for that store.
