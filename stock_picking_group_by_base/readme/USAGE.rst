Further modules need to implement this on stock.picking model:


.. code-block:: python

  def init(self):
        """
        This has to be called in every overriding module
        """
        self._create_index_for_grouping()


  @api.model
  def _get_index_for_grouping_fields(self):
        """
        This tuple is intended to be overriden in order to add fields
        used in groupings
        """
        return [
            "partner_id",
            "location_id",
            "location_dest_id",
            "picking_type_id",
        ]
