This module extends the functionality of chained (pull) stock
reservation to support the reservation of the total quantity brought by
the done chained move lines. By default, the reservation on each step of
the chain is limited to the need. If you pick more than the need, with
this module the chained moves will reserve the total picked quantity.

This operation will only apply when the available quantity exceeds the
demanded quantity and the stock rule linked to the stock move has the
field *Reserve Max Quantity* activated.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Use Cases / Context
===================

This module was developed because if you want to send variable product
weights with Warehouse configured with 2 or 3 steps for Outgoing
Shipments, you have to double check the quantity done on every picking
if the quantity done exceedes the demand quantity.

It will be useful for you if you want to auto-reserve all the quantities
done in the last steps for Outgoing Shipments.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Enter on debug mode
2. On your Warehouse, activate 2 or 3 steps for Outgoing Shipments
3. Go to Warehouse routes and open *pick + ship* (2 steps) or *pick +
   pack + ship* (3 steps)
4. Activate Reserve Max Quantity under the Propagation group in all rule
   steps except the first one
5. Create a sale with a storeable product and confirm it and has enough
   stock.
6. Go to the first picking and set quantity done over the quantity
   demanded and validate it.
7. Check that the next picking will reserve the entire quantity
   previously made instead of the quantity demanded.
