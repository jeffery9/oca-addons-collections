This module was developed to be able to print delivery slips from batches and to be able print multiple copies.

It will be useful for you if you want to print all the delivery slips included in a batch together.

Suppose the following case, batch contains 200 pickings and you need print them all because the delivery man needs to carry several copies for the delivery:

-   Option 1: You can download all pickings pdf, open them, select number of copies in each and print each one. It will be very slow.
-   Option 2: You can download a single pdf with all pickings, open it, select number of copies and print. Then you have to sort each delivery note, i.e. if you print 3 times, you have to look for delivery slip with number xxxx 3 times and put the 3 together, again with following delivery, up to 200 deliveries. It is still very slow.
-   Option 3. You can configure operation type to print picking from batch and fill number of copies. Several copies are printed and sorted. Faster.
