Facilities to check the availability of stock picking list:

* A wizard which allows on multiple stock pickings at a time to:

  * Confirm draft picking;
  * check availability of picking;
  * transfer picking;

* A scheduled action to check availability of all the stock picking.
  It is not active by default.

  This may be necessary for those who want to check the availability
  more often than running the procurement scheduler.

Configuration
=============

* The scheduled action by default search picking with state is confirmed and picking_type_code is outgoing. But you can change it by adding the following param domain in method check_assign_all():

    - domain: correct domain to search pickings you want to check assign all, state is confirmed apply by default in all cases.

    .. code-block:: python
        
        # Example 1: search without params
        model.check_assign_all()
        # Example 2: search picking with picking_type_code is outgoing and incoming and state is confirmed
        model.check_assign_all(domain=[("picking_type_code", "in", ["outgoing", "incoming"])])

Usage
=====

After selecting several pickings in tree view there are options for:
* Mark as Todo
* Check Availability
* Force Availability
* Transfer

Select additional options in the wizard if needed, after "Apply" the actions
will be applied to all selected pickings
