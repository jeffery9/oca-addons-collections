This module extends the use of sequences. It will allow you to use them
in any text field.

If configured correctly, new records will have a default incremental
value in the field of your choice.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

1. Enable developer mode.

2. Go to the form view of the model to which you want to add the new
   sequential default value.

3. Hover over the field to which you want to add the sequential default
   value. A tooltip with more info will appear.

4. Make sure the tooltip says *Type: char*. Only those fields will work.

5. Take note of the *Object* and *Field*.

6. Go to *Settings > Technical > Sequences & Identifiers > Sequences*.

7. Create one sequence with code named after this pattern:
   ``base_sequence_default.{object}.fields.{field}``. E.g.:
   ``base_sequence_default.res.partner.fields.name`` to add a default
   sequenced name for new partners. Do not use ``{}`` when adding the
   model and field name to the pattern.

8. Configure the sequence at will.

Usage
=====

To use this module, it is necessary to:

1. Follow the configuration instructions.

2. Create a record of the model you configured.

3. Leave empty the fields where you configured a sequence. If they are
   required fields, set value to "-" to trigger the automatic sequence
   on creation.

4. Check that the field defined in the sequence is set to the next value
   in the sequence.
