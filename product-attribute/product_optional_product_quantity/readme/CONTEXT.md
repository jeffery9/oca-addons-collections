Odoo has an option to define optional products for products. However sometimes optional product may have different quantity in relation to the main one.
For example you have a "Tea party set" product which consists of 4 tea cups. Your customers can also buy same cups separately.
In this case "Tea cup" will be an optional product for "Tee party set" with quantity multiplier 4.
So when you add  "Tear party set" with quantity=2 to quotation "Tea cup" with quantity=8 will be added in the "Optional products" tab.
