After configuring the module go to the website store and check your
expected results:

1.  On the search box writing the name of a product.
2.  On the product list (/shop).
3.  On the product page.
4.  On the recently viewed products.

You shouldn't be able to either see the prices or buy any of the
forbidden items if any.
