To configure journal sequences:

#. Have full accounting permissions.
#. Go to *Invoicing > Configuration > Accounting > Journals*.
#. Select or create the journal you want to configure.
#. Use *Account entry number sequence* to configure a sequence.

Note that:

* Various journals can share the same sequence.
* All journals get a shared default sequence, per company.
* Entry numbers must be unique per company. So, if you use different sequences
  per journal, make sure they don't produce colliding results.
