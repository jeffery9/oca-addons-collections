This module is intended for backend use only, and extends the functionality
of events to avoid duplicating attendees.

It is designed to work alongside *partner_event* (which is a dependency), and
it is advisable to enable it by clicking on **Create Partners in
registration**; this way it will create new partners or will match existing
ones, but at the same time will avoid creating duplicates from partners
already existing.

Usage
=====

#. Go to **Events** and choose an event or create a new one.
#. Enable **Forbid Duplicates**.
#. Go to **Attendees**.
#. Create a new attendee.
#. If you try to fill successive attendees with the same contact filled out in
   the "Attendee Partner" field, the system won't allow it. That can
   happen for example if the same email is used several times.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* This module is intended for backend use, so the validation error is enough
  to show the user what is wrong,
* When *website_event* is installed, and public users try to register more
  than one attendee, this will trigger a validation error as the attendee
  partner is duplicated. The error shown is 500 internal server error.
* It would be necessary to have a new module which depends on *website_event*
  plus this one to prevent said issue.
* Another problem would arise when used with *event_sale* module, because it
  would try to use "Sale Order" contact as attendee and that will lead to the
  issue of duplicated attendees if trying to buy access to the same event
  more than once.
