This module extends the field priority in project tasks, adding two new
levels of priority. The two new levels of priority are: High and Very
High.

On a task form, the priority widget is displayed with three stars
instead of one:

On a Kanban view, the priority widget is displayed as well with three
stars instead of one:

Without having this module installed, on the form it would look like as
that:

and on Kanban:

In case this module is uninstalled, all the tasks that were previously
set as High or Very High priority will be converted to Normal priority.
