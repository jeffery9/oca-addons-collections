To configure this module, you need to:

1.  Go to 'Sales \> Configuration \> Sales Orders \> Delivery Block Reason'.
2.  Create the different reasons that can lead to block the deliveries
    of a sales order.
3.  Add some users to the group 'Release Delivery Block in Sales
    Orders'.

Additionally, you can set a customer with a 'Default Delivery Block
Reason' policy to add that delivery block to his sales by default:

1.  Go to 'Sales \> Sales \> Customers'.
2.  In the 'Sales & Purchases' add a 'Default Delivery Block Reason'.
3.  The 'Default Delivery Block Reason' will be added automatically when
    creating a new sales order for the customer.
