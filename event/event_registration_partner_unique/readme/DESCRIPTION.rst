This module is intended for backend use only, and extends the functionality
of events to avoid duplicating attendees.

It is designed to work alongside *partner_event* (which is a dependency), and
it is advisable to enable it by clicking on **Create Partners in
registration**; this way it will create new partners or will match existing
ones, but at the same time will avoid creating duplicates from partners
already existing.
