* In the sessions form view, for now is possible to modify multiple sessions
  at the same time. This can be a bit weird for the user without having the
  "SAVE" button, as it's difficult to know when the record is going to be saved
  exactly. This feature is inspired by a core feature from recurring Calendar Events.
  And it seems that Odoo hasn't handle this dissaperance of the "SAVE" button .

  With this in mind, where propossed thre solutions:
    A. Keep it as-is
    B. Deprecate/ remove this feature
    C. Find a better way, in terms of UX
