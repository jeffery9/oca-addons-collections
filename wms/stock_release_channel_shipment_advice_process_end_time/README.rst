This module allows to set a delay time (in minutes) between the release channel
process end time and the shipment advice arrival to the dock time.

**Table of contents**

Usage
=====

To set the delay time you have three options:

1. Set a specific delay by warehouse.
2. Set the delay at the release channel.

At shipment advices creation by the release channel, odoo will consider the channel
delay time first. If isn't set, it will take the warehouse delay configuration.
