In Inventory Settings, you must have:

 * Storage Locations
 * Multi-Warehouses
 * Multi-Step Routes

A new menu in Inventory Settings allow to create new routing rules:
"Stock Routing".

Create a new routing for a location, then pull or push routing rules.
A pull rule is applied on moves with the same source location (or children).
A push rule is applied on moves with the same destination location (or children).

Rules can exclude moves based on a domain. The order of the rules is important:
the first to match is used.
