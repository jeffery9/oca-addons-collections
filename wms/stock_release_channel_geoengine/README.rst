This module enhance release channels with the addition of
a delivery zone that can be selected by the delivery manager through the UI.
If a zone is specified, the release channel will exclusively select deliveries
for partners who are localized within that zone.

Installation
============

In order to determine if a contact belongs to a geographical zone,
this module relies on the `base_geoengine` addon. Thus, the `postgis` extension
module for `postgresql` is needed for this purpose.

Configuration
=============

- On the release channel, check `Restrict To Delivery Zone`.
- Select the delivery zone.
- To exclude certain partners from selection based on their location, you can
  uncheck the "Delivery based on geo-localization?" option in the partner view.
