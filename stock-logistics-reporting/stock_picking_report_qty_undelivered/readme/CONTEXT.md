This module was developed because only products that have not yet been delivered are printed on the delivery slip, i.e. products included in backorder.

With this module you can print a summary of the products that will not be delivered even if the backorder is not created.

It will be useful for you if if you do not always deliver the full quantity ordered but you want to inform the customer of the products you are unable to deliver.
