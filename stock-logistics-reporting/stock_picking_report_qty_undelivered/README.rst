Use Cases / Context
===================

This module was developed because only products that have not yet been
delivered are printed on the delivery slip, i.e. products included in
backorder.

With this module you can print a summary of the products that will not
be delivered even if the backorder is not created.

It will be useful for you if if you do not always deliver the full
quantity ordered but you want to inform the customer of the products you
are unable to deliver.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

1. Go to Inventory > Configuration > Operation Types.
2. Select an operation type.
3. Activate **'Print a summary with undelivered qty'**

Usage
=====

    1.
5.  Click on *Mark as todo*.
6.  Add less quantity done than the quantity demand.
