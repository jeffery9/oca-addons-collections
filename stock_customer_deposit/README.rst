This module extends the functionality of the consignment stock to
support customer deposits and allows the management of customer deposits
in warehouses.

It is possible to activate the use of customer deposits per warehouse.
This will allow the use of an operation type and a route to create
customer deposits in the warehouse.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.
