At the moment, when we create a new product and choose the unity of measure **kg**, 
we have to tick the checkbox 'To Weigh With Scale' in the Point of Sale part.

We want to speed the process of creating a new product, avoiding filling manually this parameter.


This module adds the field **'To Weigh With Scale'** in UOM categories (set to **false** by default).
If checked, all products created with a related Unit will be 'To Weigh With Scale', by default.
