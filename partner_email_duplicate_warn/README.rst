This module adds a warning banner on the partner form view if another
partner has the same e-mail. It helps spot duplicate partners. If the
duplication is confirmed, the user can then use the native partner merge
wizard available from the partner tree view (menu *Action > Merge*).

It is similar to the native warning banner when another partner has the
same VAT number. T his module has a twin brother named
**partner_mobile_duplicate_warn** which adds a warning banner when
another partner has the same mobile phone number.

Usage
=====

The warning banner is displayed on the partner form view if another
partner: - has the same e-mail address (independantly from the case,
from starting spaces and ending spaces), - is not the parent nor the
child of the partner, - if the partner is attached to a specific
company: is in the same company or is not attached to a specific
company, - if the partner is not attached to a specific company: is in
any company or not attached to a specific company.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

-  Add a button "Merge partner" in the end of the warning message to
   save clicks to user.
-  Set same_email_partner_id as Many2many and find a way to display all
   the duplicate in the warning banner with clickable links.
