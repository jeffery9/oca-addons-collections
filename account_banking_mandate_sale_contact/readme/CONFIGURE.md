To configure this module, you need to:

1. Go to Settings/Sales/Invoicing and select the Default Mandates option.
   This allows you to choose if you want the mandate of the sale partner,
   invoice address or delivery address.
2. If you want to specifically change the default mandate for a customer, you can go to the "Sales & Purchase" tab of his contact form.
