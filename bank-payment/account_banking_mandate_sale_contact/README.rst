Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

1. Go to Settings/Sales/Invoicing and select the Default Mandates
   option. This allows you to choose if you want the mandate of the sale
   partner, invoice address or delivery address.
2. If you want to specifically change the default mandate for a
   customer, you can go to the "Sales & Purchase" tab of his contact
   form.

Usage
=====

For selecting the mandate at contact level:

1. Go to *Invoicing > Customers > Customers*.
2. Open or create one contact.
3. On the "Sales & Purchase" page, fill *Contact Mandate*.

Then, when you select a payment mode that requires mandate on a sale
order, Odoo will choose the mandate selected at contact level. That
mandate will be copied from the sale order to the invoice.
