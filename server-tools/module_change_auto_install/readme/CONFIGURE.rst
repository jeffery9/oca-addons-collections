* Edit your ``odoo.cfg`` configuration file:

* Add the module ``module_change_auto_install`` in the ``server_wide_modules`` list.

* (optional) Add a new entry ``modules_auto_install_disabled`` to mark
  a list of modules as NOT auto installable.

* (optional) Add a new entry ``modules_auto_install_enabled`` to mark
  a list of modules as auto installable. This feature can be usefull for companies
  that are hosting a lot of Odoo instances for many customers, and want some modules
  to be always installed.

**Typical Settings**

.. code-block:: shell

    server_wide_modules = web,module_change_auto_install

    modules_auto_install_disabled =
        partner_autocomplete,
        iap,
        mail_bot

    modules_auto_install_enabled =
        web_responsive:web,
        base_technical_features,
        disable_odoo_online,
        account_usability

Run your instance and check logs. Modules that has been altered should be present in your log, at the load of your instance:

.. code-block:: shell

    INFO db_name odoo.addons.module_change_auto_install.patch: Module 'iap' has been marked as NOT auto installable.
    INFO db_name odoo.addons.module_change_auto_install.patch: Module 'mail_bot' has been marked as NOT auto installable.
    INFO db_name odoo.addons.module_change_auto_install.patch: Module 'partner_autocomplete' has been marked as NOT auto installable.
    INFO db_name odoo.modules.loading: 42 modules loaded in 0.32s, 0 queries (+0 extra)

**Advanced Configuration Possibilities**

if your ``odoo.cfg`` file contains the following configuration:

.. code-block:: shell

    modules_auto_install_enabled =
        account_usability,
        web_responsive:web,
        base_technical_features:,
        point_of_sale:sale/purchase

The behaviour will be the following:

* ``account_usability`` module will be installed as soon as all the default dependencies are installed. (here ``account``)

* ``web_responsive`` module will be installed as soon as ``web`` is installed. (Althought ``web_responsive`` depends on ``web`` and ``mail``)

* ``base_technical_features`` will be ALWAYS installed

* ``point_of_sale`` module will be installed as soon as ``sale`` and ``purchase`` module are installed.
