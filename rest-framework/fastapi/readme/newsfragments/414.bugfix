Fix compatibility issues with the latest Odoo version

From https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/cb1d057dcab28cb0b0487244ba99231ee292502e
the original werkzeug HTTPRequest class has been wrapped in a new class to keep
under control the attributes developers use. This changes take care of this
new implementation but also keep compatibility with the old ones.
