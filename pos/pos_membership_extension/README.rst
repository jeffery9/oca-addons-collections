This module extends the functionality of point of sale module to implement
features related to ``membership_extension`` OCA module.
(https://github.com/OCA/vertical-association repository)
For the time being, it prevents cashier to sell product to customer
that doesn't belong to some membership categories.

Configuration
=============

* open a product form
* Go to the sale tab
* fill the field "Allowed Membership Categories"

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/pos/16.0/pos_membership_extension/static/description/product_form.png

* Configure also the membership categories. For that purpose, refer
  to the documentation of the OCA ``membership_extension`` module.

Usage
=====

* open the Point of Sale product

* You can see that some products have a new icon that mention
  that the product is not sallable. the icon disappear if you select
  a customer that belong to one of the membership categories :

* The module adds in the Product Pop Up info, the list of the membership categories
  allowed for the current product :

* If you select the product with an incorrect customer,
  you'll see an error Popup :

  .. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/pos/16.0/pos_membership_extension/static/description/point_of_sale_popup_error.png

* If you selected allowed restricted product for a partner, and then switch
  for another partner, a check is realized to verify that the selected products
  are allowed. If not, order lines will be removed and a popup message
  will be displayed :

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* If OCA members want to develop a module named ``sale_membership_extension``
  we should extract move some part of the code of the current module in the new module
  and make the current module depends on the new one.
