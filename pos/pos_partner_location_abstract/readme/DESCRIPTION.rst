This module implements base functionality for using different map providers in POS.
It allows to select partner location directly on a map and stores selected location in the res.partner model.
It also tries to evaluate partner's address from coordinates and provides a helper function that generates location QR code.

NB: This is a core module which is meant to be used in further customisations.
