Usage
=====

When you create a batch pick, the creation wizard will appear with the new fields added.

#. Name: Allows to rename the batch. But be careful, if this is done, it overwrites the name that Odoo assigns to the batch by default.
#. Notes: Allows to add notes to the batch.
#. Allows you to group the batch by the fields of the model stock_picking

Adds to the form view of batch picking:

**In "Draft" status:**

#. Delete all delivery notes in the batch whose status is not done or canceled.
#. Print pickings.
#. Smart button with counting and access to pickings.
#. Rename the batch if it is in draft status.
#. Date. On which the batch picking is to be processed.
#. Notes. Reflects the notes that have been entered from the wizard and allows you to modify them.
#. Delete all delivery notes from the batch whose status is not done or canceled.
#. Allows to add more fields to the list of pickings.
