To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to the form view of any record that has a mail thread. It can be a partner, for example.
#. Post a message.

The mail is now in the outgoing mail queue. It will be there for at least 30
seconds. It will be really sent the next time the "Mail: Email Queue Manager"
cron job is executed.

While the message has not been yet sent:

#.  Hover over the little envelope. You will see a paper airplane icon,
    indicating it is still outgoing.
#.  Hover over the message and click on the little trash icon to delete it.
    Mails will not be sent.
