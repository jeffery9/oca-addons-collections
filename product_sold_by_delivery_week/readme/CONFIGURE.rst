Some variables can be configured using config parameter keys:

- For hint characters:

 - For the sold char: `product_sold_by_delivery_week.sold_char`
 - For the not sold: `product_sold_by_delivery_week.not_sold_char`
 - For weeks length: `product_sold_by_delivery_week.weeks_to_consider`

Assign the security group 'Weekly selling info in order lines' and/or
'Weekly selling info in product list' to users that should see weekly
sales info in product lists or in order lines. (If you want to see the
info in other views like product recommendations, this is not needed.)
