the same product, location, lot and package.

Use Cases / Context
===================

In odoo, you can update the quantity on a quant by filling the counted
quantity on the quant form view and clicking on the "Apply inventory"
button at the end of the line. Unfortunately, nothing prevents you from
doing this for a quant and location in front of which you are standing
to perform an inventory while some quantity have already been picked
from the location by another user but not yet validated. This can lead
to stock discrepancies since the quantity you are updating is not the
actual quantity in the location for the system and when the picking will
be validated, the system will decrease the quantity you just updated by
the quantity that was picked by the other user.

This module prevents this by preventing the user from updating the
quantity on a quant if some quantity has been put as done on a move line
not yet validated for the same product, location, lot and package.

Usage
=====

To prevent inventory of quants being processed you must check the
``Stock quant no inventory if being picked`` parameter into the stock
settings panel. (stock -> configuration -> settings)
