To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Inventory > Master Data > Products* and edit a product that
   you only want to sell in the eCommerce if there is enough stock.
#. Navigate to *Out-of-stock (continue selling)* field in the *Sales* tab and unset it.
#. Go to *Inventory > Configuration > Settings*, navigate to *Stock available
   to promise* section and set the desired option (you might need extra modules). If you
   do not choose any, the value of *Available* quantity will be equal to *Forecasted*
   quantity.
