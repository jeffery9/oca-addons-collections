This module adds a warning banner on the partner form view if another
partner has the same e-mail. It helps spot duplicate partners. If the
duplication is confirmed, the user can then use the native partner merge
wizard available from the partner tree view (menu *Action \> Merge*).

It is similar to the native warning banner when another partner has the
same VAT number. T his module has a twin brother named
**partner_mobile_duplicate_warn** which adds a warning banner when
another partner has the same mobile phone number.
