To configure this module you need to:

1.  Go to *Settings \> Users & Companies \> Users*.
2.  Choose a user.
3.  From field *Deduplicate Contacts* under *Other* in *Access Rights*
    tab choose desired permission level:
    - *Manually* allows to run a manual deduplication process.

    - *Automatically* allows to run an automatic deduplication process.

      > [!WARNING]
      > Automatic contact deduplication can easily lead to unwanted
      > results. Better backup before choosing this option.

    - *Without restrictions* executes chosen deduplication method with
      admin rights, to be able to update objects where the user would
      not normally have write rights, and to allow them to merge
      contacts with different email addresses.

      > [!WARNING]
