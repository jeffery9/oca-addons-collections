This module allows you to check/uncheck the new 'Show details' and
'Show subtotal' flags in *Sale order section lines* and
*Customer invoice section lines* if you want to show or hide their
lines or their subtotals in the PDF report and in the website.
You can also show or hide the section subtotal and line amount by
checking or unchecking the new 'Show section subtotal' and
'Show line amount' flags.
