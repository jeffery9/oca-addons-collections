Use Cases / Context
===================

This module was developed to be able to print delivery slips from
batches and to be able print multiple copies.

It will be useful for you if you want to print all the delivery slips
included in a batch together.

Suppose the following case, batch contains 200 pickings and you need
print them all because the delivery man needs to carry several copies
for the delivery:

-  Option 1: You can download all pickings pdf, open them, select number
   of copies in each and print each one. It will be very slow.
-  Option 2: You can download a single pdf with all pickings, open it,
   select number of copies and print. Then you have to sort each
   delivery note, i.e. if you print 3 times, you have to look for
   delivery slip with number xxxx 3 times and put the 3 together, again
   with following delivery, up to 200 deliveries. It is still very slow.
-  Option 3. You can configure operation type to print picking from
   batch and fill number of copies. Several copies are printed and
   sorted. Faster.
