Allow to indicate on a product packaging package type that it comes with a container deposit. The deposit product should be a service product.
For instance, you can create a package type "plastic box" and indicate as container deposit "plastic box deposit".

Use the corresponding sales and purchase modules to add the deposit fees in the order. Each packaging level can have a deposit. The biggest package type of each packaging level will be used in the computation unless a specific package type is given on the order line.
