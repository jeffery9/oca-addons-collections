To select the users that have access to a given document page you need
to open a document, go to the 'Security' tab and select which groups
will have access.

Only users that belong to the 'document_knowledge / Manager' group can
manage access groups to documents.

If no groups are selected in a document, all users that can access
document pages can access this document.
