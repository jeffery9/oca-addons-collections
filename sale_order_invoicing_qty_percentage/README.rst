This module allows to invoice a percentage of the sales order, modifying
invoiced quantities according such percentage.

Example: You have a service line to invoice 10 hours. You choose to invoice
a 50% of the quantity, so the generated invoice line has 5 hours.

Usage

   "Create Invoice" button.
#. On the popup that appears, select "Percentage of the quantity" on the
   "Create invoice" selection, and put a percentage quantity.
#. Click on "Create and View Invoice" button.
#. On the newly created invoice, you'll see that the invoiced quantity is the
   expressed percentage.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

- You can put any percentage in the field, including amounts higher than 100%,
  or negative ones. This can be seen as a disadvantage, or an extra feature.
