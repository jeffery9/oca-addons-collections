1.  Go to *Contacts*.
2.  Search for the contact linked to the salesman user and open it.
3.  If it's actually linked to a user, you'll see a new check in the
    *Agent information* page, called "Convert salesman into agent".
4.  Check it for having that salesman automatically populated as agent.
    You need to assign a commission to that agent as well.
